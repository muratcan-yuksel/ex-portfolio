              As a lifelong learner, these days I'm interested heavily with the
              web3 space. I've developed a couple of NFT websites for the Solana
              blockchain already, but I'm more interested in Ethereum
              blockchain, as I develop with Solidity mainly.

              I travelled most of the European countries, lived, worked and
