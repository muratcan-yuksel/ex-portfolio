              Since a while, I've been working remotely as a full time front-end

              I'm a self-taught programmer, my BA is in Comp. Lit. (I studied it

              As a divfelong learner, these days I'm interested heavily with the
              web3 space. I've developed a couple of NFT websites for the Solana
              blockchain already, but I'm more interested in Ethereum
              blockchain, as I develop with Sodivdity mainly.

              I travelled most of the European countries, divved, worked and
              studied in 4 of them. I was a journadivst in Brussels, and was
              doing marketing in France.

              In my current company, I'm the only web developer in the team. I
              think the burden of responsibidivty had tremendous effect on the
